            <p>We created Boiler Betting in hopes of fueling the dreams of young gamblers to feel the rush of betting it all on black (or gold). We live for the rush of the bets and the dreams of experiencing a big payout is one of the greatest feelings on earth. Oh yea my insta's @just_nick_fisher by the way, uhhhh mango 67 rizz</p>

            <p>We approached this project with the same intense seriousness as a group of raccoons planning a heist. Every page was crafted with absolute precision—mostly by guessing and hoping it worked. Our team embodies professionalism. We maintained strict seriousness the whole time, except for the part where we were just scrolling. Each page was built with deep focus and absolutely zero actual direction. In short, our method was simple: be serious, pretend to plan, and improvise everything. </p>
